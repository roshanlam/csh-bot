# Discord Bot


This bot is for my discord server that I made where me and my friends talk about studies and other random stuff.

The purpose of this bot is to help make the discord server more lit and make us practice some coding lol


## ToDos
- [ ] Let discord members search for exactly what they are looking for
- [ ] Setup jenkins on raspberry pi so the code on raspberry pi can be updated every time there are new code being pushed into the main branch.
- [ ] Setup MongoDB on raspberry pi
- [ ] Integrate an inverted index to make the search efficient and fast, maybe also use machine learning for it but the first version will be very basic.
